*EECS PhD, UC Berkeley (starting Fall 2020)*  
*Computer Science B.S., Cornell University (Dec 2019)*

I'm just starting out my PhD and am interested in **distributed systems research**.  
In my spare time, I love playing badminton, teaching, and listening to classical music.

## Extra-curricular projects
### Cornell Design & Tech Initiative
[DTI](https://www.cornelldti.org/) for short, a project team focused on using technology to generate community impact. That means creating events to educate students on web and mobile technologies and creating apps and websites to help the student community.
My proudest achievement is the establishment of biweekly DevSeshes and onboarding sessions for developers on the team, in which I taught developers on the team upcoming technologies such as React, Firebase, and Android/iOS programming.

Here are some projects I've worked on as part of the team.

> A platform to gather all events on campus. I was a front-end developer, then product manager on this subteam. I've helped program all aspects of the app, including its Android (Java), iOS (Swift), backend (Django), and frontend (React) components. It's currently in beta.

> #### Cornell Orientation

> An app to provide students with personalized events for orientation week based on the college they're enrolled in, with built-in search, filters, and directions. I created the Android (Java) and iOS (Swift) portions of the app, as well as rewriting the backend from Django to Firebase.

> An iOS, Android app + website for students at Newton South High School to check which classes they can skip for that day. It's integrated into each students' daily schedule so they are each alerted which of their teachers are absent. The app read emails sent by the principal's secretary, parsed it with PHP, stored the data in MySQL, and beamed messages to users detailing their updated schedule. I was the sole Android and iOS developer on the app, working with [Eric Lin](https://github.com/EricSihaoLin), the backend developer. I also rewrote the backend in PHP and frontend in Polymer.js, pushed by Google as an Angular alternative at the time.
